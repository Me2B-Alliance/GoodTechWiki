We propose a method to makesuch privacy choices more salient to Internet users. Basedon an approach to automatically identify and classify opt-out choices in privacy policies, we designed a browser ex-tension that notifies users about available opt-out choiceson the websites they visit. The goal of our work is to notonly make users aware of available choices but also make iteasier for them to utilize those choices
