The NAI Code of Conduct, is a set of self-regulatory principles which all NAI member companies must agree to uphold in order to be members. The Code requires notice and choice with respect to Personalized Advertising, limits the types of data that member companies can use for advertising purposes, and imposes a host of substantive restrictions on member companies' collection, use, and transfer of data used for Personalized Advertising.
