D&S fellow Mark Latonero was quoted in this Reuters piece detailing how human traffickers can use technology to further commit crimes.

    “Traffickers are using the scale and popularity of online services to essentially hide in plain sight,” he said.

    “Even if we identified all traffickers or victims online, law enforcement and social services lack the manpower and resources to effectively respond,” added Latonero, who is also a fellow at the U.S.-based Data and Society Research Institute.
