CHI 2018 Workshop on General Data Protection Regulation: An Opportunity for the HCI Community?, Apr 2018

With the implementation of the GDPR, users are expectedto have more choices regarding their online privacy. How-ever, it is important to understand the current paradigm ofhow these online privacy choices are offered by websites,and evaluate whether people can use them effectively. Inthis workshop paper we present our progress on an empir-ical study of websitesâ€™ data deletion and opt-out choices.We find that although privacy choices are being offered,there is variation across websites in terms of where thosechoices are located and how they are described. Resultsfrom our analysis could help pinpoint these inconsisten-cies and improve the overall user experience for expressingthese types of privacy controls.
