 Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for verifiable, "self-sovereign" digital identity. DIDs are fully under the control of the DID subject, independent from any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority. DIDs resolve to DID Documents â€” simple documents that describe how to use that specific DID.

This document specifies the algorithms and guidelines for resolving DIDs and dereferencing DID URLs.
