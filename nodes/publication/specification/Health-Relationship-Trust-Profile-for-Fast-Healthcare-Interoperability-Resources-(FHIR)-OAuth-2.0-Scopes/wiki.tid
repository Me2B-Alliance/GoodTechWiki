FHIR is an HTTP-based, resource-oriented RESTful API based on a set of clinical, administrative, financial, and infrastructure resource definitions. The API supports create, read, update, delete, and search operations, as well as a framework for ad-hoc operations.

The OAuth 2.0 protocol framework defines a mechanism to allow a resource owner to delegate access to a protected resource for a client application, optionally limited by a set of scopes.

This specification profiles the OAuth 2.0 protocol scopes to be used with the FHIR protocol to increase baseline security, provide greater interoperability, and structure deployments in a manner specifically applicable to (but not limited to) the healthcare domain.
