Propagation of distributions using a Monte Carlo method

This Supplement to the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM) is concerned with the propagation     of     probability     distributions     through     a     mathematical     model     of     measurement     [ISO/IEC  Guide  98-3:2008,  3.1.6]  as  a  basis  for  the  evaluation  of  uncertainty  of  measurement,  and  its  implementation  by  a  Monte  Carlo  method.  The  treatment  applies  to  a  model  having  any  number  of  input  quantities, and a single output quantity. The   described   Monte   Carlo   method   is   a   practical   alternative   to   the   GUM   uncertainty   framework   [ISO/IEC Guide 98-3:2008, 3.4.8]. It has value when a)    linearization of the model provides an inadequate representation or b)    the  probability  density  function  (PDF)  for  the  output  quantity  departs  appreciably  from  a  Gaussian  distribution or a scaled and shifted t-distribution, e.g. due to marked asymmetry. In case a), the estimate of the output quantity and the associated standard uncertainty provided by the GUM uncertainty  framework  might  be  unreliable.  In  case  b),  unrealistic  coverage  intervals  (a  generalization  of  “expanded uncertainty” in the GUM uncertainty framework) might be the outcome.
