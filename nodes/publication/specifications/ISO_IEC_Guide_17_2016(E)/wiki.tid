Guidelines for addressing sustainability in standards

It is important that the views of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are sufficiently considered  during  the  development  of  standards  and  that  standards  aimed  at  large-scale  or  mass  production are not too costly and complex for SMEs to implement.SMEs benefit from standards, however they may have a weaker position in their market because of their dependency on larger competitors, suppliers or customers or they may have to adapt to existing solutions on the market.SMEs are present in the majority of sectors. As do other users, SMEs benefit from the technical expertise of standards in the elaboration of which they may not have been present. Nevertheless, there are also sometimes advantages to being small as they can adapt quickly, can be more flexible and can have smaller overhead.Furthermore, if standards were to take into consideration the SME perspective, considerable benefits would accrue to all the stakeholders involved in standardization.The aim of this Guide is to raise awareness on the issues that may be of importance to SMEs. By addressing the needs of SMEs, the use of standards may be significantly increased and SMEs will be able to gain the full benefit of utilizing standards.
