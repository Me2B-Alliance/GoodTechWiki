Purchase information on goods and services intended for consumers

ISO/IEC Guide 14:2003 is applicable to the provision of information concerning products and services before purchase. It outlines general principles and recommendations for contents, methods, formats and design such that the information will enable consumers to compare and choose products or services. Furthermore, ISO/IEC Guide 14:2003 recommends general rules for the creation and implementation of purchase information systems and purchase information bodies.

It is addressed to the following: committees preparing standards for consumer products or services; product designers, manufacturers, technical writers or others engaged in the work of drafting such information, and, in particular, those who are members of purchase information bodies; other bodies such as enforcement agencies or consumer ombudsmen.

ISO/IEC Guide 14:2003 does not deal with conformity assessment or instructions for use. It does not give detailed guidance on information that is provided verbally or electronically.
