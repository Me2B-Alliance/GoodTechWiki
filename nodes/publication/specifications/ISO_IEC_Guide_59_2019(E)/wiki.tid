ISO and IEC recommended practices for standardization by national bodies

ISO/IEC GUIDE 59:2019(E)IntroductionStandardization brings technological, economic and societal benefits. Standards help to harmonize technical and other specifications of products and services making industry more efficient and removing barriers to trade.Standards are considered an essential component of the “quality infrastructure”, the system comprising organizations (public and private), policies, relevant legal and regulatory framework and practices which is needed to support and enhance the quality, safety, and sustainable soundness of goods, services and processes.Standards are developed by many bodies, at the national, regional and international levels. Alongside the growth of international trade, technological and societal cooperation, standards bodies have developed procedures and modes of cooperation which are commonly considered to constitute good practices for standards development at all levels. The use of standards is voluntary unless they are cited as requirements in legislation or in legal contracts.The foundations of ISO’s and IEC’s membership and participation models are at the national level. ISO and IEC, together with their national bodies, are responsible for fostering and ensuring coherence and coordination.The ISO and IEC system for standardization is based on collaboration agreements between ISO and IEC and an extensive array of collaboration agreements among regional, national and other standards bodies
