Standardization and related activities â€” General vocabulary 

ISO   (the   International   Organization   for   Standardization)   and   IEC   (the   International   Electrotechnical   Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of ISO   or   IEC   participate   in   the   development   of   International   Standards   through   technical   committees   established  by  the  respective  organization  to  deal  with  particular  fields  of  technical  activity.  ISO  and  IEC  technical  committees  collaborate  in  fields  of  mutual  interest.  Other  international  organizations,  governmental  and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISI/IEC Directives, Part 2. Draft  Guides  adopted  by  the  responsible  Committee  or  Group  are  circulated  to  national  bodies  for  voting.  Publication as a Guide requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. The first edition of this Guide was published by ISO in 1976. It was prepared by the United Nations Economic Commission  for  Europe  (UN/ECE)  in  consultation  with  ISO,  primarily  to  facilitate  the  work  of  the  UN/ECE  aimed  at  removal  of  barriers  to  international  trade  arising  from  lack  of  harmonization  of  standards  or  inadequate international application of standards. The second, thirdandfourth editions of ISO Guide 2 added new terms and definitions in more or less isolated groups, within no overall planned framework. Work on a systematically structured revision was authorized by the ISO Council in 1981 as the principal task of a working group within the ISO Committee on standardization principles (ISO/STACO), including IEC and UN/ECE spokesmen and in cooperation with the ISO Committee on conformity assessment (ISO/CASCO) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Conference (ILAC). The main reason for this activity was a request from UN/ECE for complete and urgent revision of ISO Guide 2 to take into account a number of specific problems raised by the UN/ECE Government Officials Responsible for Standardization Policies as well as the proposed terminology being prepared in the UN/ECE Working Party on  Building.  Moreover,  ISO  was  publishing  an  increasing  number  of  Guides  on  standardization  policies  and  procedures, several of them in conjunction with IEC. To guard against terminological inconsistencies, a clear understanding  of  basic  concepts  needed  to  be  established,  and  unambiguous  general  terms  and  definitions  provided.
