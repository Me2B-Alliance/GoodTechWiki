Algorithmic management—whether it’s Uber assigning rides to drivers or retailers doling out shifts through automated scheduling—often keeps workers in the dark, she says, giving them less say over how and when they work. That sort of precarity isn’t new for most workers—the idea of workplace stability has historically been 'a myth' for all but a privileged class of worker, she notes. Even if gig economy labor shifts away from contracting, employers likely will look to retain the flexibility through temping and other arrangements. — Data & Society Research Lead **Alex Rosenblat** cited in *WIRED*
