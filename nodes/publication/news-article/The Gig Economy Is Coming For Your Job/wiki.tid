These currents in hospitality represent a subtle, sneaky form of technological displacement, care of the gig economy. They’re not robots stepping in for humans on a factory floor, but rather smartphone-based independent contractors and supplemental 'cobots' (a portmanteau of 'co-worker' and 'robot') chipping away at the careers of full-time and in some cases unionized employees. — E. Tammy Kim, *The New York Times*
