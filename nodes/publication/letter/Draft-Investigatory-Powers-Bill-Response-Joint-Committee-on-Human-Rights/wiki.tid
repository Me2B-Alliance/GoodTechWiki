At 296pages long the draft Investigatory Powers Bill is a long and complex documentwhichproposes a broad range of intrusive powersincluding a number of bulk powers which have the potential to impact on the human rights of all citizens.Should this draft Bill become law,proper independent safeguards will be necessary. It should be noted that the Joint Committee tasked with scrutinising the draft Bill have only been given 7 weeks to conduct their evidence gathering and report to Parliament. Compared with previous scrutiny committee’s thisis not enough time to fully assess the impact the proposals will have on citizens.
