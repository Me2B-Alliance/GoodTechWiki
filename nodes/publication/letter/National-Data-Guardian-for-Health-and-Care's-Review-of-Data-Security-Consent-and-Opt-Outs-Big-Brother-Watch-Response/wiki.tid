Big Brother Watch is a civil liberties and privacy campaign group founded in 2009. We produce unique research which exposes the erosion of civil liberties in the UK, looks at the dramatic expansion of surveillance powers, the growth of the database state and the misuse of personal information.We were a member ofcare.data advisory groupand gave oral evidence to the Health Select Committee on the scheme.  We have also produced FOIreports on the number of data breaches suffered by NHS bodies.  We are responding to this consultation in a professional and public capacity.
