We are writing to you concerning the Metropolitan Police Service’s decision to film the recentchildren’s ‘Climate Strike’ Protest in Parliament Square on Friday 15th March 2019.During the Climate Strike protest, a unit of two Metropolitan Police Service officers wasobserved using a handheld video camera to film the protest at several locations in and aroundParliament Square. The Climate Strike protest was composed almost entirely of children ofschool age, with many even under the age of 10. There were of course adults present, notleast given the age of some of the children at the protest, however the vast majority of peoplepresent were 18 or under.
