This report by Data & Society Researcher Bonnie Tijerina and Michael Zimmer is the culmination of gatherings that brought together different privacy practitioners to discuss digital privacy for libraries.

    “While the recent surge in privacy-related activities within the library community is welcome, we see a gap in the conversations we are having about privacy and our digital presence – a knowledge gap, a lack of shared vocabulary, disparate skill sets, and varied understanding. This gap prevents inclusion across the profession and lacks clarity for those responsible for building tools and licensing products.”
