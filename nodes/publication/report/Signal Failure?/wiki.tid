Key FindingsAccording to a Freedom of Information request made by Big Brother Watch to Transport for London, TFL operates at least 82,826 CCTV camerasIn the last twelve months, 6,972 police requestsfor footage were granted by TFLAccordingly, footage from 91.6% of cameraswas not used by the policeThis is based on a generous assumption that footage from no camera was requested more than once, meaning that just 8.4% of TFL’s cameras were used in the prosecution of a crime. Consequently, the police did not request footage from more than 9 in 10(91.6%) of cameras.
