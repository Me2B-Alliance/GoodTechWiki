D&S researcher Monica Bulger and D&S research analysts Patrick Davison and Mikaela Pitcan’s recent work with “The Legacy of inBloom” was profiled in this piece by Education Week.

    “Not understanding something is not a reason for not allowing it to happen,” Monica Bulger, one of the report’s authors, said in an interview with Education Week. “When there are misunderstandings, people turn to fear-based scenarios. It’s appropriate to evaluate whether those fears are accurate.”
