A PIA rests on two pillars:1. fundamental  principles  and  rights, which are “non-negotiable”, established by law and which  must  be  respected  and  cannot  be  subject  to  any  variation,  regardless  of  the  nature, severity and likelihood of risks;2. management of data subjects’ privacy risks,which  determines  the  appropriate  technical and organizational controls to protect personal data.
