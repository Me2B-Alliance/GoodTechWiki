Building off the research for her book Uberland: How Algorithms are Rewriting the Rules of Work, Data & Society Researcher Alex Rosenblat explains algorithmic management in the gig-economy.

    “Data and algorithms are presented as objective, neutral, even benevolent: Algorithms gave us super-convenient food delivery services and personalized movie recommendations. But Uber and other ride-hailing apps have taken the way Silicon Valley uses algorithms and applied it to work, and that’s not always a good thing.”
