D&S research analyst Mikaela Pitcan wrote a brief overview discussing student data privacy.

    Student data privacy conversations center on concerns regarding the safeguarding of data collected in educational settings. These concerns oftentimes revolve around a fear of student information being sold to third parties for targeted advertising purposes. Other concerns include the hyper surveillance of vulnerable groups of students, schools selling studentsâ€™ personal details to marketing companies, and schools using data to make potentially damaging decisions about children.
