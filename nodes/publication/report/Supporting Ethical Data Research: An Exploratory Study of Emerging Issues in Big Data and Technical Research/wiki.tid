In the era of big data, how do researchers ethically collect, analyze, and store data? danah boyd, Emily F. Keller, and Bonnie Tijerina explore this question and examine issues from how to achieve informed consent from research subjects in big data research to how to store data securely in case of breaches. The primer evolves into a discussion on how libraries can collaborate with computer scientists to examine ethical big data research issues.
