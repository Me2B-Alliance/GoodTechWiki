DIDs(decentralized   identifiers)   are   a   new   type   of identifier  intended  for  verifiable  digital  identity  that  is "self-sovereign",   i.e.,   fully   under   the   control   of   the identity   ownerand   not   dependent   on   a   centralized registry,  identity  provider,  or  certificate  authority.  DIDs resolve to DDOs(DID descriptor objects)—simple JSON documents  that  contain  all  the  metadata  needed  to  prove ownership  and  control  of  a  DID.  Specifically,  a  DDO contains  a  set  of key  descriptions,  which  are  machine-readable descriptions of the identity owner’s public keys, and   a   set   of service   endpoints,   which   are   resource pointers  necessary  to  initiate  trusted  interactions  with  the identity  owner.  Each  DID  uses  a  specific DID  method, defined   in   a   separate DID   method   specification,   to define  how  the  DID  is  registered,  resolved,  updated,  and revoked on a specific distributed ledger or network.
