People  in  many  parts  of  the  developing  world  have little    or    no    infrastructure    for    well-regulated government and commercial processes. This creates a pressing  need  for  a  safe  place  to  store  important personal  data  needed  to  access  financial,  insurance, education and healthcare services. A universal digital identity    system    would    underpin    information assurance  through  verifiable  and  reliable  data  that can be presented when required. This paper presents a strong use case for a self-sovereign identity system with   verifiable   information   and   user-controllable release.
