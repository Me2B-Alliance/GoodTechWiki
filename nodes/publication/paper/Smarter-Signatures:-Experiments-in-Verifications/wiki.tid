ABSTRACT: Technologies like the Web of Trust and PKI lay the foundation for identity on the internet: they map a human persona to a cryptographic construct that is represented by a public key and protected by a private key. Digital signatures are fundamental to these digital identities and have been widely used in a variety of applications. Theyâ€™re the heart of SSH, the foundation of certificates, and the core of newer technologies like blockchain.
