25th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference, RE:Next! Track, Lisbon, Portugal, Jun 2017

Privacy laws and international privacy standards require that companies collect only the data they have a stated purpose for, called collection limitation. Furthermore, these regimes prescribe that companies will not use data for purposes other than the purposes for which they were collected, called use limitation, except for legal purposes and when the user provides consent. To help companies write better privacy requirements that embody the use limitations and collection limitation principles, we conducted a case study to identify how purpose is expressed among five privacy policies from the shopping domain. Using content analysis, we discovered six exclusive data purpose categories. In addition, we observed natural language patterns to express purpose. Finally, we found that data purpose specificity varies with the specificity of information type descriptions. We believe this taxonomy and the patterns can help policy analysts discover missing or underspecified purposes to better comply with the collection and use limitation principles.
