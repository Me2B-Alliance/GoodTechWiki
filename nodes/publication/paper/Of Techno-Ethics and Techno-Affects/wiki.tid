Making humans accountable for the algorithms they design shows that the biases algorithms produce are far from inevitable. However, an exclusive focus on humanness can also misfire. That is, the more blame for ethical failure is placed on one side of the human-technology equation, the more it might seem that either getting rid of humans altogether might prevent ethical failures in the present or elevating some humans to the position of social designers will solve these problems. — Data & Society Director of Research **Sareeta Amrute**, *Feminist Review*
