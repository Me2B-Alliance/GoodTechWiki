This document is an “Explainer” as requested by the Technical Architecture Group at the W3C. An explainer for explainers can be found here: https://github.com/w3ctag/w3ctag.github.io/blob/master/explainers.md 
We’ve populated this document with the template provided in that link.  As the document evolves, there will be a period with a confusing mix of references to "your feature" and concrete explanations about DIDs.
NOTE: In essence, every sentence should support the delineation of what is in scope and out of scope.
