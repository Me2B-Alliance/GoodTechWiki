In this document we report on the results of a usability study of a privacy enhancing tool, Scramble! , which was designed for Facebook users by researchers from the KU Leuven (see Beato et al., 2011).The usability study was run at Carnegie Mellon University in  the summer of 2013by a team combining researchers from different SPION-member institutions. In the last 10 years, the success of online social networks (OSN) has raised significant privacy concerns. The wealth of data that can be collected by OSN providers has raised questions  regarding the balance of power between data subjects and data holders, their respective trade-offs, and how to balance their respective interests.
