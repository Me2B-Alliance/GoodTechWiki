Humanity has been contemptuously used by vast digital empires. Thus it is now necessary to replace these empires with decentralized networks of independent individuals: as in the first decades of the Internet. As our participation has been voluntary: no one doubts our right to take this step. But if we are to persuade as many people as possible to join together and make reformed networks possible: we should declare our reasons for wanting to replace the old.
