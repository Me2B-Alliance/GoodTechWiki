The intention behind Part 5 of the Digital Economy Bill; to improve data sharing across Government, is something we support. A well established and well defined data sharing scheme for Government is essential not just for Government to function in a data driven society, but in order to enable better public services, benefit the vulnerable and needy in society and help with research and statistics; it will be a critical part of every citizenâ€™s engagement with the State. Unfortunately Part 5 in its current form, we believe, will fail to establish a clear, well defined, efficient, principled and legal data sharing process.
