In this briefing, we focus on police forces’ use of automated facial recognition technology and seek to inform parliamentarians of the significant risks it poses to civil liberties and the rule of law in the UK. We seek to draw your attention to the facts: that there is no law, no oversight, and no policyregulating the police’s use of automated facial recognition. We also explain why automated facial recognition has proven to be an ineffective policing tool producing high numbers of ‘false positive’ matches. Furthermore, research has found that many automated facial recognition algorithms have discriminatory effect, disproportionately misidentifying black and female faces. Finally, we discuss the impact of automated facial recognition on human rightsinthe UK and question whether suchbiometric checkpoints are, or could ever be, compatible with the rights framework. Secondly, we raise the issue that the custody image database is oversized and is highly likely to retain images unlawfully. The antiquateddatabase of 21 million photos stores imagesof innocent people who neither received a conviction nor are of any policing interest. The storage of such photos was ruled unlawful in 2012 by the High Court in RMC and FJ v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis and Secretary of State for the Home Department. However, it is this database with which facial recognition technology is used by police.
