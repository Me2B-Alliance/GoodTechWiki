Big Brother Watch calls on Members of Parliament to oppose the Online Forums Bill.The Online Forums Bill would:Unacceptably place legal responsibility on internet users for other users’ expressionEncourage erratic citizen policing of speech on online forums, including the censorship of lawful expressionCreate a barrier to community discussion and organising for groups through the banningof private forums and imposition of legal liability for administrators, with a particularly negative impact on marginalised communities such as addiction and recovery groups, sexual abuse victim groups, and community or campaigning groups organising their work.Have a chilling effect on free expression online
