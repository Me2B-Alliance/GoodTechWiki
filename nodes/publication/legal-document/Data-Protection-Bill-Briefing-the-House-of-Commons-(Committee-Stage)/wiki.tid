In  anticipation  of  Committee  Stage  of the  Data  Protection  Bill  in  the  House  of  Commons, commencingon Tuesday13March 2018,we would like to draw your attention to a number of concerning  issues  within  the  Bill,and we proposeamendments thatare  required  in  order  to protect well-established privacy rights, maintain adequacy with EU law, and upholdthe public’s data protection rights.We proposeamendments to:Ensure thatwhere human rights are engaged by automated decisions, there are always ultimately humandecisions;Ensure  that thesafeguard  of human involvement  in  automated decision-making  is always meaningful;Uphold  the  existing  application  of  data  protection  rights  in  the broad context  of immigration data processing;We would also like to draw your attention to elements within the Bill which are of concern:The national security certificationregime which lacksoversight and time-limitation;andThe  issue  of  whether  theUK’s data protection regime is sufficiently protective to be subject to an ‘adequacy’ decision in order to share data freely with the EU post-Brexit.
