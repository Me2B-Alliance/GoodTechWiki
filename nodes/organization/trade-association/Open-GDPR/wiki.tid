OpenGDPR is an open-source initiative setting a common framework for brands and technology companies to cooperate around the fair and transparent use of consumer data. Companies that adopt the framework can quickly and efficiently honor data subject rights related to personal data requests as set forth under the provisions of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.
