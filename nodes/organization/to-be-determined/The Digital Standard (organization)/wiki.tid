Open for Collaboration. Please Participate!

We are inviting participation from the wider community of organizations and individuals invested in these critical consumer issues. Addressing consumer privacy and security is a vast and evolving challenge that exceeds any one organization.

The standard is open for comments, additions, and revisions from members of the tech community--researchers, developers, advocates, and hobbyists--who want to help. With larger community engagement in this open-source project, the partners will continue to shape, refine, test and improve the standard in order to ensure it is comprehensive, effective, and up-to-date in a rapidly-changing marketplace.

To facilitate participation, we have published the standard text on GitHub, a common platform used in the tech community to debate ideas and collaboratively build shared projects. You can use GitHubâ€™s built-in features to leave comments, propose changes, or fork the project to take it in a new direction. The text of the standard is also shared under the Creative Commons open license CC-BY.
