Datawallet is a digital wallet for your data
With Datawallet, consumers have a simple, private and meaningful way to control their data, and in return, companies receive insights from the best quality, ethical, first-party data available. Datawallet enables companies to transform regulatory compliance into trusted relationships with consumers. When companies give their customers Datawallets, they show they’re serious about data rights while boosting their operations on an unparalleled scale.

Datawallet allows customers to visualize the data they create, set permissions for their data, and receive rewards for allowing companies to use their data. Through Datawallet’s personal API, your customers can leverage additional data from Facebook, Google, and Amazon, enabling companies to deliver personalized experiences that are unmatched by their competition.

Datawallet products are seamlessly implemented with efficient mapping of your current data environment for CCPA compliance. Uniquely adaptable, Datawallet generates the visuals, controls and structures that are most important to you. Gain trust with transparency and control, and provide customers a clear-cut guide about how you’re using their data with fine-grained permissioning over its access. Powered by blockchain, every permissioning change is stored in an easily auditable blockchain record.
