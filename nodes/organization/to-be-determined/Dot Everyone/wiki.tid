Doteveryone is the responsible technology think tank. We research how technology is changing society: create products and prototypes that show what responsible technology looks like: and catalyse communities to create change. Responsible technology promotes a fair: inclusive and thriving democratic society. It works in the best interests of the individual and of the public as a whole: safeguards against harm and is founded on fair and transparent value exchange between people and technology.Responsible technology promotes a fair: inclusive and thriving democratic society.
