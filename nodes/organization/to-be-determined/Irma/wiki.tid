IRMA is produced and run by the Privacy by Design Foundation. In 2016 this foundation grew out of the Digital Security research group from Radboud University at Nijmegen, The Netherlands. It is an independent non-profit foundation. Since 2019 it has a strategic cooperation with (SIDN), the foundation that runs the .nl domain. This cooperation contributes to IRMA's stability and continuity.

With IRMA it is easy to log in and make yourself known, by disclosing only relevant attributes of yourself. For instance, in order to watch a certain movie online, you prove that you are older than 16, and nothing else.

With IRMA you can also sign documents digitally. You use only relevant attributes of yourselves in a digital stamp. In this way you can sign with IRMA as a medical doctor, or as citizen, or in some other role.

Data in IRMA come from trusted sources and are cryptographically protected. Thus, the attributes that you disclose to make yourself known are genuine and are really about you.
