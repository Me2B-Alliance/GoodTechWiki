Enigma was created
to solve the privacy crisis.
The most difficult problems demand innovative solutions. Today, many of the world's biggest challenges arise from over-centralization. We believe that decentralized systems like Enigma can help us solve them.

When too-big-to-fail banks nearly destroyed the global economy in 2008, a decentralized digital currency - Bitcoin - was born in response. Now, an over-centralized internet and large tech monopolies have put our privacy, our security, and our society at risk. Enigma's solutions are part of the foundation for a decentralized, more secure, more sustainable internet - and a better world.
