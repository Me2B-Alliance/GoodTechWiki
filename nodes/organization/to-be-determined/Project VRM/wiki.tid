ProjectVRM is a development and research project of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. It has two purposes:

    To encourage development of tools by which individuals can take control of their relationships with organizations — especially in commercial marketplaces.

The project was created by Doc Searls when he became a fellow at the Center in 2006. Since then it has grown to play a driving role in many different development categories. (A partial and ever-changing list of those, and their occupants, is here.)
