Customer Commonsâ€™ mission is to restore the balance of power: respect and trust between individuals and organizations that serve them: and does not take contributions from commercial entities. 

As a public-facing organization focused on emerging issues at the intersection of empowered customers and the public good: Customer Commons seeks to both educate and inspire change for customers worldwide. We do this through research: educational initiatives and promotion of customer-side tools.
