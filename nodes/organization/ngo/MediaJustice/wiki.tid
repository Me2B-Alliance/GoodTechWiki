MediaJustice is leading the fight for racial and economic equity in a digital age. For communities of color: lower income families and the social movements they fuel: transforming systemic barriers and “beating the odds” in the 21st century demands a fair economy: connected communities: a political landscape of visibility: voice and power. To achieve this we need a media and technology environment that fuels real justice. We call that “Media Justice” and recognize this as a crucial moment in our struggle for freedom—freedom from oppression: freedom to communicate.
