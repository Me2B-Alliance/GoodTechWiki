Three or four times a year weâ€™ll be selecting a book that helps us deepen our knowledge on how we build a more equitable community and hosting an event to discuss the topic further. Book Club is open to all and we look forward to seeing you at a future event. Stay in the loop and enter your email below to be notified when we schedule our next book club event.
