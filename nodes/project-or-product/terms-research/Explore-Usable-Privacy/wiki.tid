Explore our Results

The Usable Privacy Policy Project develops techniques to semi-automatically analyze privacy policies with crowdsourcing, natural language processing, and machine learning. You can explore some of the projectâ€™s privacy policy annotations which identify different data collection and use practices.

Data presented here are made available for research and teaching. Our results showcase both the power and limitations of human and machine annotation.
