The Internet has changed the rules for what is and isnâ€™t possible in Washington, DC. We know that you can use the Internet to strike a nerve, reach hundreds of millions of people and channel their outrage into strategic action. So when governments, companies, or private individuals try to use technology to threaten your digital rights, we organize massive protests online and IRL to help millions of people just like you fight back ðŸ¥Š
