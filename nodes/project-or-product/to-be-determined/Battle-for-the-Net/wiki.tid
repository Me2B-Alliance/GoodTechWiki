A bombshell court decision just reignited the fight for net neutrality. Lobbyists for big cable companies are already swarming Congress to push bad legislation that will allow ISPs to continue throttling Internet speeds and imposing unfair fees. But we have a strategy to fight them in DC and at the state level and restore net neutrality once and for all. Contact Congress now to demand your lawmakers pass the bipartisan Save the Internet Act.
