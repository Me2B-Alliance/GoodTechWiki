Facial recognition technology is incredibly invasive - it threatens human society and basic liberty in a way that far outweighs any potential benefits.

But right now there are almost no laws limiting its use. So far, politicians in D.C. have failed to act.

We’re deploying a team across D.C. using Amazon’s commercially available facial recognition software to scan and capture images of everyone they pass. We’re finding and identifying government officials, members of Congress, and journalists to demonstrate how facial recognition works, how dangerous and invasive it is, and to highlight why we need to ban it now.
