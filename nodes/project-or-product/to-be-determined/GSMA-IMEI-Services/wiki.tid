As the body authorized by 3GPP to allocate TAC (Type Allocation Code) for all GSM mobile device identities globally, the GSMA is the source of authoritative and complete IMEI data. We provide organizations with a range of products and services that harness the unrivalled accuracy of our data to provide the highest-quality device intelligence.

Today, stakeholders use the GSMA TAC and IMEI datasets to help with device management (business intelligence, marketing & customer support) and crime prevention (detection of theft, fraud and device laundering).
