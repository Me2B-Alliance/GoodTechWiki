With full-disk encryption, secure boot, proximity-based security, encrypted backups, and vulnerability audits, Helm puts security first.

Helm stores data securely using full disk encryption using keys that are managed by a Secure Enclave.

The Helm Personal Server runs a secure and minimal Linux-based operating system built using Yocto.

It leverages well-known open-source projects like Docker, Postfix, Dovecot, Let's Encrypt, Nextcloud and more bundled into easy-to-use services.

Helm is engineered to dissipate heat through its aluminum base without using a fan resulting in a silent device.

Each device comes with 120 GB of durable SSD storage and a slide-in tray designed for a 2.5" hard drive, increasing storage up to 5 TB.

The Helm personal server connects with your existing home network. Network configuration is not required for email services.
