The emergence of global privacy laws like the CCPA and GDPR introduce new data privacy rights for consumers and data subjects across the globe – requiring businesses of all sizes to comply with large volumes of consumer and data subject rights requests. Responding to these requests is a time-consuming process full of manual tasks, making it a challenge to respond to regulatory requirements and the need to detect exactly where consumer data exists, in order to access, port, delete it, or comply with CCPA opt-outs. As data models become more complex and consumers continue to exercise their data privacy rights, fulfilling these tasks manually is no longer a scalable solution for any organization.
