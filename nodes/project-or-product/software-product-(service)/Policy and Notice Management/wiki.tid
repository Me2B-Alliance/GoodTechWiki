Global privacy laws like the CCPA and GDPR have created many challenges for organizations trying to manage privacy policies and disclosures throughout their digital channels. The complexity of managing policies across the range of regulations, geographical regions, languages and digital platforms has become inefficient, unscalable for businesses of all sizes.

Companies need to be able to identify web forms, policies and disclosures that exist across their digital properties and update and publish them within specific time periods to adhere to the range of global privacy regulations.

The OneTrust Policy and Notice Management solution simplifies the complex process of creating, updating, and monitoring policies across websites and applications into one central location while eliminating the need of complex development work.
