The Trusted List Scheme Operator (TLSO) of an EU MS is the body responsible for the operation and/or management of the assessment scheme of that Member State.
Following the operation/management of that scheme, the Scheme Operator maintains and publishes the corresponding Member State Trusted List (CD 2009/767/EC and amendments, part of the legal framework).
