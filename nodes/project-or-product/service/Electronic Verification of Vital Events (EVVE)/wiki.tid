EVVE, operated by the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS), provides customers with the ability to quickly, reliably, and securely verify and certify birth and death information. Electronic inquiries from authorized users can be matched against over 250 million birth and death records from state and jurisdiction owned vital record databases nationwide. An electronic response from the state or jurisdiction either verifies or denies a match within matter of seconds. No other system on the market provides access to a more complete set of state and jurisdiction owned vital records than EVVE.

EVVE does not verify that an individual presenting documents is in fact the person described on those documents. Rather, EVVE verifies that there is a birth record in the state for the person named on the birth
