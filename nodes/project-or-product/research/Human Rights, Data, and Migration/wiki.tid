As data-driven technologies and digital ecosystems increasingly intersect with migrants, refugees, and the displaced, what are the social impacts, consequences, and tradeoffs? This project bridges the knowledge gap surrounding technological interventions, and addresses a diverse set of themesâ€“movement, economic inclusion, integration, asylum, identification, information seeking, rights, health, and social support.
