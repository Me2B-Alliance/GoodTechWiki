* Develop a truly global vision for mobile identity
* Encourage global information and best practice sharing
* Promote global standardization and interoperability for mobile identity

SSEDIC.2020 will develop strategic actions plans responding to eIDAS and the SSEDIC recommendations for

* government and EC encouragement
* private sector adoption
* harmonizing mobile authentication mechanisms suitable for eID use
* coordinated approach to education in the mobile identity domains
