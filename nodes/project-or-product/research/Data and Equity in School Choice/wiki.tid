The Data and Equity in School Choice project aims to better understand whether, and in what ways, and to what ends, parents and youth draw on publicly available school performance data when making decisions about where to apply and enroll. We will explore how parents and young people in New York City experience school selection in a context in which admission decisions to both public and charter schools are made, at least in part, by algorithm.
