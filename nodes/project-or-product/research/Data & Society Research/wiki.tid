Research at Data & Society is shaped by cross-cutting themes:

    How do we understand and combat vulnerabilities in socio-technical systems?
    Can we use a rights-based framework to guide the development of artificial intelligence?
    How do we facilitate ethical design and effective regulations as human labor meets intelligent systems?

Vulnerabilities in socio-technical systems

While calls for greater accountability mechanisms within socio-technical systems are widespread, these systems are increasingly subject to manipulation, such as from biased data that infuse algorithmic models. These conditions require an assessment of strategic manipulation, a broad imagination about the possibilities for encoding fairness and accountability into technical systems, and deep ethnographic research that describes and understands new social activity.
