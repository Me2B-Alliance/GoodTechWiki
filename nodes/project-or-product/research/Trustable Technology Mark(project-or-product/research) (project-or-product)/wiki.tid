The Trustable Technology Mark aims to highlight the work of those companies that put in the extra effort of building truly trustworthy devices.
Who is behind this?

The Trustable Technology Mark is a ThingsCon initiative. It is developed with support from the Mozilla Foundation in the form of a Mozilla Fellowship for project lead and ThingsCon co-founder Peter Bihr.

ThingsCon is a global community & event platform for IoT practitioners. Our mission is to foster the creation of a human-centric & responsible Internet of Things (IoT).
